Mr-Racoon: Ah! Just the bot I was waiting for. Welcome to my factory headquarters.
Mr-Racoon: "You’ve been chosen for something very important – the Build Battle. It isn’t just any contest… it’s the ultimate test of creativity, speed, and survival!"
- Build Battle? Why me?
- Really? Tell me more 'bout it..
Mr-Racoon: Because you’ve got something most robots don’t. You’re not just built to follow orders… you can think, you can adapt, and you never give up.
Mr-Racoon: In the Build Battle, you’ll face challenges where you must craft, climb, and outsmart your rivals. It won’t be easy. But if you succeed… you’ll prove that you’re more than just another machine.
orange_bot_character: I won’t let you down.
Mr-Racoon: Good. Let's wait for the elevator to get to the factory. The arena awaits… and so does your destiny.
